### Learning a Mathematical Function through Reinforcement Learning


Program learns the function target = sin(x âˆ’ 3) cos(y) + N(0, 0.1), where N is randomly destributed with mean = 0 and standard dev = 0.1

### Usage:
```
python2 SuperLearn.py
```
should output f10000

### Plotting:
```
python2 plot.py f10000
```


This is an assignment from a class on Reinforcement Learning, taught by Richard Sutton, the father of Reinforcement Learning
